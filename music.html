        From the smoky blues clubs, where the legendary
        <span class="reinkies_normal">B.B. King</span> captivates audiences with
        his signature vibrato, to the sun-kissed fields of EDM festivals, where
        <span class="reinkies_normal">Da Tweekaz</span> pumps up the crowd with
        the energetic beat of 150bpm. From the thunderous heavy metal, where
        <span class="reinkies_normal">Disturbed</span> proves that a little bit
        of headbanging never killed anyone, to the elegant world of classical
        music, where one is left in awe by the virtuosity of
        <span class="reinkies_normal"> Paganini </span>, the Devil's Violinist.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seemingly endless array of emotions, thoughts, and experiences that
        music has and will continue to evoke are truly captivating.

        <br /><br />
        I have always been enamored with the sounds of music. The way that
        individual sounds come together to form harmonies, chords, and even
        disharmony, is truly magical. A few notes can make you question your
        existence, while a few more can provide the answers, or just confuse you
        even more. Together, they form a scale, which is just a fancy word for a
        musical rollercoaster. My dream is to one day master an instrument,
        hopefully without setting it on fire in the process, and I hope to take
        piano lessons in the future. For now, I am self-taught on both guitar
        and piano. Though my attempts on the latter are akin to a cat trying to
        type on a keyboard, I find joy in the struggle to improve. But what I
        love most is the ability to create music with multiple instruments at
        once. Inspired by the likes of
        <span class="reinkies_normal">Hans Zimmer</span> and
        <span class="reinkies_normal">Two Steps From Hell </span>, I have begun
        to dabble in composing my own pieces. With the aid of technology, I am
        able to craft each note and instrument with precision, spending as much
        time as I need to bring my creations to life. You can listen to one of
        my early pieces below, which I recommend experiencing with headphones. I
        hope you enjoy it!<br />
